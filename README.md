# 100-days-python-coding-challange
Hello welcome to this  100 days code challange,
Here we are excited to Learn More,

So, Everyone Asking the Question What is python language?
Give them by this reply,
Lets Begin the Definition  

"Python is a Versatile language and the Simple programming. It is a high-level programming language that is widely used for general-purpose programming. It is known for its readability and simplicity."

Making it accessible for beginners while also powerful enough for professionals. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, and has a large standard library that facilitates the development of a wide range of applications. 
 
It is an interpreted language, which means that code can be executed line by line, making it easy to test and debug. 

# Applications of Python
Python is popular in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

# Just i am Sharing my eXperiences. It gives you well understanding.

#Day1
1st Day Started with "Hello World" program
print("Hello World")

Reapone Code : Hello World

This is my first code 

In the same way we have learn about what are the syntax Errors?

A syntax error in Python occurs when the code violates the language's rules for structure and formatting. These errors are typically detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is actually executed. Common causes of syntax errors

print("Hello, World"  # Missing closing parenthesis

# like the same way error will happens in the python Code.


Day-2
values and variables.

values can perform of numbers, strings, booleans, Integers, Float by assignment operator (=)

1.string is nothing but a stream of characters (" ")
2. Integers can be defined as a numbers either positive or negative numbers 
3. Booleans are ( True or false)
4. Float can be known as numbers with decimal points
